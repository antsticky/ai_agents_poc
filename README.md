# AI Agent PoC

An AI agent is a system that perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve a goal. It‚Äôs like a digital decision-maker that uses data and logic to act intelligently.

## Core Components of an AI Agent:
- **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with (e.g., a game, a robot‚Äôs surroundings, or a user interface).

- **Sensors**: Tools to perceive the environment (e.g., cameras, microphones, or data inputs).

- **Actuators**: Tools to act on the environment (e.g., motors, clicks, or text responses).

- **Agent Function**: The logic or algorithm that decides what action to take based on perceptions.
